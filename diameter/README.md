## Introduction

Before dive into diameter protocol, you should be familiar with telecommunications networks such as traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and describe the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) that integrates the internet with wireless technologies. Then explanation about the _IP 
Multimedia core network Subsystem_ (IMS) developed based on UMTS, which enhances the functionality of the packet-switches service domain.

In PSTN, the real-time billing information is delivered through the Signaling System no.7 (SS7) network. During the call setup/release process, 
the monitor system tracks SS7 message of the call and, once the call is complete generates a Call Detail Record (CDR) in the AMA format. 
The CDR is then transferred to the rating and billing system.

In the traditional circuit-switched domain, a CDR is the computer record produced by a telephone exchange containing details of a call that passed through it.
In the packet-switched domain, a CDR is generated by generated by a network node for a data session. The "CDR" term is referred to as a Charging Data Record.
Based on book "Charging for mobile all-IP telecommunications" by Dr. Yi-Bing Lin, CDR stands for "Call Detail Record" in a typical telephone call, and for
"Charging Data Record" in a data session.
