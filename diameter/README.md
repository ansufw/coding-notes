## Introduction

In PSTN, the real-time billing information is delivered through the Signaling System no.7 (SS7) network. During the call setup/release process, 
the monitor system tracks SS7 message of the call and, once the call is complete generates a Call Detail Record (CDR) in the AMA format. 
The CDR is then transferred to the rating and billing system.

In the traditional circuit-switched domain, a CDR is the computer record produced by a telephone exchange containing details of a call that passed through it.
In the packet-switched domain, a CDR is generated by generated by a network node for a data session. The "CDR" term is referred to as a Charging Data Record.
Based on book "Charging for mobile all-IP telecommunications" by Dr. Yi-Bing Lin, CDR stands for "Call Detail Record" in a typical telephone call, and for
"Charging Data Record" in a data session.
